### Idea Background

People who struggle with legal document preparation due to lack of legal expertise or access to affordable professional assistance. This tool is designed for individuals and small businesses who need support in creating formal documents like complaints, contracts, and appeals.

### A Problem Situation Faced by Many Users
1. Lack of Legal Knowledge
Problem: Many people face challenges in understanding and drafting legal documents because they lack formal legal education or experience.
They are unsure about the structure, required elements, and proper legal terminology.

In the same study, 61.6% of respondents evaluated that legal services in society are quantitatively insufficient.


2. Cost and Time Barriers
Problem: Hiring a lawyer or legal professional can be expensive and time-consuming.
Simple document preparation often involves significant financial investment.
Individuals with limited budgets may feel discouraged from pursuing legal remedies or formal agreements.

Statistics: A 2020 report from the Judicial Policy Research Institute highlights that legal service costs pose a major burden to the public, prompting discussions on introducing legal service insurance systems.
