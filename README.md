## 📖 Topic

### Idea background

People who need SKT NUGU voice recognition service - We want to implement a function for those who are placed in the blind spot of information (features for the deaf)

### A problem situation in which the deaf are present

**1. the difficulty of social communication**

Problem: Deaf people have great difficulty in everyday conversation, communication in public, communication in emergency situations, etc.

Statistics: According to a study, more than 50 percent of deaf people say they feel socially isolated because of difficulties in everyday conversations

**2. emergency response**

Issue: Response may be delayed due to failure to hear voice notifications (fire alarms, car horns, etc.) in an emergency.

Statistics: Approximately 30% of deaf people reported experiencing danger from not being aware of sound-based alerts in emergency situations

### Goals

Development of real-time voice-to-text conversion/hazard detection apps for the deaf

Objective: To help the hearing impaired by converting the voice into real-time text for easy conversation of daily conversations, 

and to let them know by vibration if they hear dangerous sounds.
